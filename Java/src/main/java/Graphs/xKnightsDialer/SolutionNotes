We can think of this problem as the total number of unique paths the knight can travel making n hops because to dial distinct numbers, the path taken by the knight must be unique.

In this post I want to explain how I came up with a solution to this problem. This approach can be used to solve other similar problems such as Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum etc.

Imagine an 8 x 8 chess board with Knight (k) sitting at some index (i, j). The board would look as follows,

*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
*   *   b   *   c   *   *   *
*   a   *   *   *   d   *   *
*   *   *   k   *   *   *   *
*   h   *   *   *   e   *   *
*   *   g   *   f   *   *   *
*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
[0] If k is at index (i, j), then in a single hop, k can move to 8 possible positions which are below.

a (i - 1, j - 2)
b (i - 2, j - 1)
c (i - 2, j + 1)
d (i - 1, j + 2)
e (i + 1, j + 2)
f  (i + 2, j + 1)
g (i + 2, j - 1)
h (i + 1, j - 2)
[1] Conversely, you can also say that in a single hop, there are 8 possible places (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h) from which you can move to k.

Math behind the solution:

Consider a function paths(i, j, n) which calculates the total number of unique paths to reach index (i, j) for a given n, where n is the number of hops. From [0] or [1], we can recusively define paths(i, j, n) for all non-trivial (n > 1, that is, more than one hop) cases as follows,

paths(i, j, n) = paths(i - 1, j - 2, n - 1) +
                 paths (i - 2, j - 1, n - 1) +
                 paths (i - 2, j + 1, n - 1) +
                 paths (i - 1, j + 2, n - 1) +
                 paths (i + 1, j + 2, n - 1) +
                 paths  (i + 2, j + 1, n - 1) +
                 paths (i + 2, j - 1, n - 1) +
                 paths (i + 1, j - 2, n - 1)
If we translate this to plain english, all we are saying is "the total number of unique paths to (i, j) for certain hops n is equal to the sum of total number of unique paths to each valid position from which (i, j) can be reached using n - 1 hops".

If you are confused why it is n - 1 hops, note that when we are at (i, j), we already made one hop and we have n - 1 hops more to take.

For the trivial case (n = 1, that is no hops), the problem states that this must be considered as one path. Therefore, paths(i, j, n) = 1, for n = 1.

A Sample Trace

If the above recursive equation or it's translation is not very enlightening, you can follow this sample trace to get a better understanding of the logic.

Our keypad is a 4 x 3 matrix which looks like below.

1   2   3
4   5   6
7   8   9
*   0   *
Note that in the code there is no need to use a matrix like this. This is just for explanation purpose.

We shall trace the recursion tree of paths(0, 0, 3) in this section, that is, all the possible unique paths from 1 (0, 0) in 3 hops. From 1 (0, 0), in a single hop, we have two possible places to jump to - 6 and 8.

Wait! Didn't I say that a knight can jump to 8 possible places in a single hop some where in this post?

..."in a single hop, k can move to 8 possible positions"...

Yes, a knight can jump to 8 possible places in a single hop and this is still true. However, 6 of the other hops will take you outside of the matrix. You will see later in the code how this is being handled as a part of base case.

A brief on notation:

I am representing each node in the recursion tree something like X (i, j, n). This means that we are at the call paths(0, 0, 3) and the knight is currently sitting on the number X with n - 1 hops remaining.

Below is the recursion tree for paths(0, 0, 3).

Note: The following tree diagram is not visually appealing with the old UI. I recommend to view this in the new UI for a proper visual representation.

                              1 (0,0,3)
			               /		     \
				          /               \
			  	  6 (1,2,2)             8 (2,1,2)
			   	/   |    \                |   	\
			   /	|	  \		          |  	 \
	1 (0,0,1)  0 (3,1,1)  7 (2,0,1)   1 (0,0,1)  3 (0,2,1)
Since, 6 jumps are invalid, that leaves us with only two valid jumps e (i + 1, j + 2) and f (i + 2, j + 1) from 1 (0, 0). In other words, from 1 the knight can jump only to 8 and 6.

In fact, in this matrix, the maximum number of valid jumps you can make is 3 which is from 4, 6.

Explanation of this recursion tree is below,

From 1 (0, 0, 3), the knight can go to 6 (1, 2, 2) and 8 (2, 1, 2) in a single hop. As we go down the recursion tree, we pass the number of hops to make as 1 less than the current.

From 6 (1, 2, 2), it can go to 1 (0, 0, 1) , 0 (3, 1, 1) and 7 (2, 0, 1). We pass n as 1 as we are going down in the recursion. At this point, each of these calls return 1 (since n = 1 which is the trivial case).

Therefore, [2] 6 (1, 2, 2) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which means that there are 3 unique paths from 6 when n = 2 and they are 61, 60, 67.

From 8 (2,1,2), it can go to 1 (0, 0, 1) and 3 (0, 2, 1). At this point, each of these calls return 1 (since n = 1).

Therefore, [3] 8 (2, 1, 2) = 1 + 1 = 2, which means that there are 2 unique paths from 8 when n = 2 and they are 81, 83.

Finally, 1 (0, 0, 3) = 6 (1, 2, 2) + 8 (2, 1, 2)

From [2], [3], we can write this as,

1 (0, 0, 3) = 3 + 2 = 5, which means that there are 5 unique paths from 1 when n = 3 and they are 161, 160, 167, 181, 183.

Naive Recursive Code


public static final int max = (int) Math.pow(10, 9) + 7;

public int knightDialer(int n) {
   long s = 0;
   //do n hops from every i, j index (the very requirement of the problem)
   for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
         s = (s + paths(i, j, n)) % max;
      }
   }
   return (int) s;
}

private long paths(int i, int j, int n) {
   // if the knight hops outside of the matrix or to * return 0
   //as there are no unique paths from here
   if(i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= 4 || j >= 3 || (i == 3 && j != 1)) return 0;
   //trivial case
   if(n == 1) return 1;
   //non trivial case
   long s = paths(i - 1, j - 2, n - 1) % max + // jump to a
            paths(i - 2, j - 1, n - 1) % max + // jump to b
            paths(i - 2, j + 1, n - 1) % max + // jump to c
            paths(i - 1, j + 2, n - 1) % max + // jump to d
            paths(i + 1, j + 2, n - 1) % max + // jump to e
            paths(i + 2, j + 1, n - 1) % max + // jump to f
            paths(i + 2, j - 1, n - 1) % max + // jump to g
            paths(i + 1, j - 2, n - 1) % max; // jump to h
   return s;
}
If you run this code for n = 50 in your favorite programming language, you will realize that it takes at least an hour to get the answer.

This is because this problem not only has similar subproblems but each of those similar subproblems have overlapping subproblems. What does this mean? Let me explain with an example.

tion to 8 (2, 1, 2) while computing the solution to 1 (0, 0, 3) and there is no need to re-compute this solution if were to store the solution somewhere in memory. The above recursive solution re-computes the solutions to overlapping subproblems and therefore is highly inefficient (runs in the order of O(3 ^ n) I believe).
